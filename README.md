# Nutrition Recommender

This application was developed during YantraLearning Hackathon at Yantra 7.0, and was also presented in Yomari Codecamp 2019 (LOCUS) at Pulchowk Campus.

The solution we proposed and initiated was to develop an application that could suggest various foods and diet to the app users, based on their BMI, the diseases they are suffering from, and the historical data of what foods they are taking daily.

We used Supervised Machine Learning approach to predict the nutrition requirements of a user based on the variables like height, weight, age, sex, diseases, activities and food intake data. 

I worked specifically in the front-end android application development. Our team **erSathi** was composed of four members. We won the prize for **Best Presentation** in both of the events.
